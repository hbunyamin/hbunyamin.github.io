I"q<p>This post is inspired by <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/fogm/2020F/index.html">the lectures given by David Blei</a> on Thursday, 17 September 2020. One of the topics he explained was related to <strong><em>categorical variable</em></strong> and a <strong><em>categorical distribution</em></strong>. Therefore, this post elaborates those two concepts.</p>
