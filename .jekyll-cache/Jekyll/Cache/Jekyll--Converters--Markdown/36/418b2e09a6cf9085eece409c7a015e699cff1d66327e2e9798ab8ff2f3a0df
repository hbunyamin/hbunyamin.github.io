I"p<p>The subchapter 2.5 of <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/BDA3.pdf"><strong>Bayesian Data Analysis Third Edition</strong></a> explains how to estimate a normal mean with known variance; particularly, the subchapter extends the development of a normal model with a single observation into the more realistic situation where <em>a sample of independent and identically distributed observations</em> $y = (y_1, \ldots, y_n)$ are available.</p>

<p>The <em>posterior</em> density of the normal model consists of a <em>likelihood</em> distribution, $\Pr(y \mid \theta)$, and a <em>prior</em> distribution, $\Pr(\theta)$. Specifically,
\(\begin{align}
	y_i \mid \theta &amp;\sim \text{N}(\theta, \sigma^2) &amp;&amp; \text{A normal distribution with mean = }\theta   
\end{align}\)</p>
