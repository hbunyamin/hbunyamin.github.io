I"œ<p>Before we discuss what a forgiven sinner is, let me explain what <strong>the gospel</strong> is. The reference of this post comes from ‚Äú<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Reformed-Sen-Sendjaya/dp/0367857510/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1SG1NN6NBYDP2&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=leadership+reformed+why+leaders+need+the+gospel+to+change+the+world&amp;qid=1594708594&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=leadership+reform%2Caps%2C378&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>Leadership Reformed Why Leaders Need the Gospel to Change the World</strong></a>‚Äù by Sen Sendjaya.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The gospel</strong> is the good news that God is renewing all things in creation through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Historically, the gospel is understood as the good news that by God‚Äôs unmerited grace, guilty sinners who deserve His just punishment have been fully pardoned and accepted on the grounds of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The gospel tells us that we have been saved from God, by God, and for God alone.</p>

<p>God saved sinners through the death and resurrection of Christ for Himself. We are recipients, but not the ultimate goal, of salvation. The grand story of salvation is the story of God‚Äôs renewing all creation, restoring the broken world. Moreover, as His redeemed people, we now live and work for His glory, advancing His kingdom, redeeming all things towards the new heaven and earth. We are the <em>Forgiven Sinners</em>.</p>
