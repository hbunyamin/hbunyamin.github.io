<p>There are a few optimization algorithms which are faster than <em>gradient descent</em>. In order to understand these optimization algorithms, we need to understand the concept of <strong>exponentially weighted moving averages</strong>.</p>

<p>Suppose that the temperature of day $i$ is denoted by $\theta_i$ from $i=1, \ldots, 365$ (how many days in one year?). Visually, the temperatures are shown in $\text{Figure 1}$. Furthermore, we show several examples of the temperatures as follows:</p>

\[\begin{align}
	\theta_1 &amp;= 40^{\circ} \text{F} \\
	\theta_2 &amp;= 49^{\circ} \text{F} \\
	\theta_3 &amp;= 40^{\circ} \text{F} \\	
	         &amp;\vdots \\
	\theta_{180} &amp;= 60^{\circ} \text{F} \\		         
	\theta_{181} &amp;= 56^{\circ} \text{F} \\		      
			&amp;\vdots
\end{align}\]

<p>As we can see in the image above, the values of temperatures during a year are <em>noisy</em> which means that there is considerable variation in the values. The variation is caused by <em>noise</em> and <em>we need to remove the variation</em> if we want to expose the underlying values of temperatures (Brownlee, 2019).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do we remove the noise which resides in the values of time series?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the techniques to remove the noise is called <strong>smoothing</strong>. Particularly, the common technique used commonly in time series forecasting is <strong>exponentially weighted averages</strong>. Computing <strong>exponentially weighted averages</strong> involves constructing a new series whose values are calculated by the average of raw observations in the original time series. Let’s denote the new series as $v_t$ for $t=1, 2, \ldots, 365$ as follows:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
 		v_t = \beta v_{t-1} + (1-\beta) \theta_t \tag{1}\label{eq:weighted-averages}. 
	\end{equation}\]

<p>with $v_t$ is the average at time $t$, $\theta_t$ is the temperature at time $t$, and $\beta$ is the parameter determining <em>average number of days’ temperatures</em> ($0 &lt; \beta &lt; 1$). Specifically,</p>

\[\begin{equation}
v_t \approx \pmb{\text{average }} \text{over } \frac{1}{1-\beta} \text{ days' temperature} \tag{2}\label{eq:parameter-beta}. 
\end{equation}\]

<p>For example, let’s define $\beta = 0.9$ which means that we compute $v_t$ as approximately an average over</p>

\[\begin{align}
	\frac{1}{1-\beta} &amp;= \frac{1}{1-0.9} \\
	                  &amp;= \frac{1}{0.1} \\
	                  &amp;= 10 \text{ days}.
\end{align}\]

<p>Similarly, $\beta = 0.98$ gives approximately an average over $50 \text{ days}$.
$\text{Figure 2}$ shows the plot of these weighted averages.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/moving-average-at-beta-0.9-and-0.98.png"><img src="/assets/images/moving-average-at-beta-0.9-and-0.98.png" alt="img1" class="img-responsive" /></a><em><center>$\pmb{\text{Figure 2}}$: A plot of $v_t$ at $\beta=0.9$ ($\pmb{\text{red}}$) and $\beta=0.98$ ($\pmb{\text{green}}$).

<br /></p>

<p>As an extreme example, $\beta = 0.5$ computes approximately an average over $2 \text{ days}$ as depicted in $\text{Figure 3}$. These weighted averages are noisy because the computation of these averages takes only $2 \text{ days}$ before.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/moving-average-at-beta-0.5.png"><img src="/assets/images/moving-average-at-beta-0.5.png" alt="img1" class="img-responsive" /></a><em><center>$\pmb{\text{Figure 3}}$: A plot of $v_t$ at $\beta=0.5$ ($\pmb{\text{yellow}}$).

<p>From those three different values of $\beta$, we can see that as $\beta$ is getting larger and larger, the plot is going smoother and smoother. On the other hand, if $\beta$ is getting smaller and smaller, the plot will become noisier and noisier. As a conclusion,</p>

<p>\(\begin{align}
	\beta \ggg \; &amp;\Longrightarrow \pmb{ \text{ smoother}}  \text{ because we are averaging more days} \\
	\beta \lll \; &amp;\Longrightarrow \pmb{ \text{ noisier}} \text{ because we are averaging fewer days}.
\end{align}\) <br />

<h4 id="bias-correction"><strong>Bias Correction</strong></h4>
<p>Previously, we have defined Equation \eqref{eq:weighted-averages} which is</p>

\[\begin{equation}
 		v_t = \beta v_{t-1} + (1-\beta) \theta_t. 
	\end{equation}\]

<p>Let’s substitute $v_{0} = 0$ and $\beta = 0.98$ into Equation \eqref{eq:weighted-averages}.  <br />
At $t=1$,</p>

\[\begin{align}
		v_1 = \beta v_{0} + (1-\beta) \theta_1 &amp;\Leftrightarrow v_1 = (0.98) (0) + (1-0.98) \theta_1 \\
                                               &amp;\Leftrightarrow v_1 = 0.02 \; \theta_1 \tag{3} \label{eq:v-1}.
	\end{align}\]

<p>At $t=2$,</p>

\[\begin{align}
		v_2 = \beta v_{1} + (1-\beta) \theta_2 &amp;\Leftrightarrow v_2 = (0.98) (0.02 \; \theta_1)  + (1-0.98) \theta_2 \\
                                               &amp;\Leftrightarrow v_2 = 0.0196 \; \theta_1 + 0.02 \; \theta_2 \tag{4} \label{eq:v-2}.
	\end{align}\]

<p>With the assumption that $\theta_1$, $\theta_2 &gt; 0$, we arrive at</p>

\[\begin{equation}
v_2 \ll \theta_1 \text{ and } v_2 \ll \theta_2
 \end{equation}\]

<p>which means that $v_2$ <em>is not a very good estimate</em> of the first two days’ temperature of the year.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can we improve the estimate of the first two days’ temperature?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Introducing <strong>bias correction</strong> will improve the estimate. With $\beta = 0.98$,</p>

\[\begin{align}
		v_t &amp;\approx \text{ average over } \frac{1}{1-0.98} \\
			&amp;\approx \text{ average over } 50 \text{ days' temperature};
	\end{align}\]

<p>moreover, at $t=2$, the <strong>bias correction</strong> factor will be</p>

<p>\(\begin{align}
		1 - \beta^t &amp;= 1 - (0.98)^2 \\
		            &amp;= 0.0396 \tag{5} \label{eq:bias-correction}
	\end{align}\)
Therefore, the <strong>bias correction</strong> for $v_2$ will be</p>

\[\begin{align}
		\frac{v_2}{1-\beta^2} &amp;= \frac{v_2}{0.0396} &amp; \text{ from Equation }\eqref{eq:bias-correction}.
	\end{align}\]

<p>Since $v_2$ is divided by $0.0396$ which acts as a <strong>bias correction</strong>, the bias from $v_2$ will be removed and the estimate of $v_2$ is improving. Generally, the form of <em><strong>weighted averages with bias correction</strong></em> is defined as</p>

<p>\(\begin{equation}
		\frac{v_t}{1 - \beta^t} = \beta \; v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta) \; \theta_t. \tag{6} \label{eq:with-bias-correction}
	\end{equation}\)
with $t=1,2, \ldots, 365$.</p>

<p>As a final note, the <strong>bias correction</strong> <em>helps us find better estimates of a series during the initial phase of learning</em> as we will see in the Part 2 of this blog. As $t$ is getting larger and larger, $\beta^t \approx 0$. Therefore, if $t$ is large, the <strong>bias correction</strong> will have no effect on the series.  <br />
