I"ª<p>The Subchapter 2.5 of <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/BDA3.pdf"><strong>Bayesian Data Analysis Third Edition</strong></a> explains how to estimate a normal mean with known variance; particularly, the subchapter extends the development of a normal model with a single observation into the more realistic situation where a sample of independent and identically distributed observations $y = (y_1, \ldots, y_n)$ are available.</p>

<p>The posterior of the normal model consists of a likelihood distribution, $\Pr(y \mid \theta)$, and a <em>pdf</em> of prior, $\Pr(\theta)$.</p>
