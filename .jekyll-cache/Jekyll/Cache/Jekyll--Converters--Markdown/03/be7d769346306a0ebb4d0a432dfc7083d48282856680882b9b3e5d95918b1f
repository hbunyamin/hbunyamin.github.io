I"ç<p>Common classification problems in Machine Learning (ML) are binary and multi-class (Sokolova and Lapalme, 2009). For binary classification, we have <em>accuracy</em>, <em>precision</em>, <em>recall</em>, and a combination of <em>precision</em> and <em>recall</em> which is so-called <script type="math/tex">F_1</script> score. However, the <em>precision</em> and <em>recall</em> from binary classification cannot be utilized to measure multi-class classification, automatically .</p>
