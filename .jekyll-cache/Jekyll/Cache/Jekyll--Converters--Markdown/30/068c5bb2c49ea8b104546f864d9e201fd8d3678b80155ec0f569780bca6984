I"r<p>This article is inspired by <a href="http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e161/lectures/gaussianprocess/node7.html"><em>a website</em></a>, which is unfortunately has been down since around July 8, 2021. The website elaborately explained that both <strong>marginal distributions</strong> and <strong>conditional distributions</strong> of <em>subvector of multivariate normal random variables</em> given <em>the remaining elements</em> are indeed <strong>multivariate normal distributions</strong> as well. I feel obliged to write the content of the broken website in a blog which, hopefully, every learner can learn and benefit.</p>
