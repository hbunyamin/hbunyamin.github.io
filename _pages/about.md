Hendra Bunyamin is an associate professor who graduated from Mathematics department Bandung Institute of Technology and Software Engineering, Informatics department from the same university.     
    
He is very passionate about teaching. Mainly, he teaches mathematics, artificial intelligence (AI), and programming.    
   
His research interests are applying machine learning algorithms into various problems.      
    
During his undergraduate study, he studied Statistics under [Pak Sutawanir Darwis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ojCW8aIAAAAJ). His undergraduate final project was about spatial prediction using [Kriging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging) which was also known as _Gaussian process regression_.     

He took his master study in Software Engineering. Furthermore, his master thesis explored [_Latent Semantic Indexing_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis) and his advisor was [Pak Rila Mandala](https://itb.ac.id/staf/profil/rila-mandala).     
   
His interest in Machine Learning started when he took [Stanford Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng in Coursera](https://youtu.be/gb262LDH1So?si=QujlL3a4av5eyBoa). The way Andrew Ng taught has inspired him and since then he have been learning machine learning and its applications until now.
